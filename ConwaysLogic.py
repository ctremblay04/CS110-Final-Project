"""This class implements the logic for Conways Game of life. Conways game
of life is a cellular automation developed by John Conway in 1970. A cell
is either alive or empty in a grid. The grid is then updated such that any
cell that is alive with two or three adjacent live cells stays alive, any
other live cell dies and vacates its cell leaving it empty. A cell that is
empty is born if it has exactly three adjacent cells that are alive, any
other cell that does not meet such condition stays empty."""
